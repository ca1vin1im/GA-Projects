# Project 2: Ames Housing Pricing Prediction

## Problem Statement
Clean, explore and analyse Ames Housing Dataset to develop 3 models (Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge), narrowing down to 1 production model (Lasso) based on the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to predict house sales prices for Ames homeowners and advice ways to maximise sales prices as your data-driven property consultant.

## Background

Properties such as houses are amongst an individual's or a family's major financial committment and investment. Naturally, most Ames homeowners would desire knowing the fair value of their property and ways to maximise their home sales prices. 

### Dataset Used

Data set containing information from the Ames, Iowa Assessorâ€™s Office will used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010.

## Recommendations, Next Steps and Conclusion

With the aim of helping Ames homeowners determine the fair value of their property and identify ways to maximise their home sales prices, I cleaned, explored and analysed Ames Housing Dataset to develop 3 models (Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge), narrowing down to 1 production model (Lasso) based on the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to predict house sales prices for Ames homeowners and advice ways to maximise sales prices.

This Lasso house sales prices model predicts the fair value of your Ames home. Additionally, I provided the maximum sales price for each Ames neighbourhood so you know the reasonable upper limit of the value of your priced home. 

I also identified the **top 20 factors** with the greatest impact on Ames home sales prices, with the top 5 listed below:
- **'gr_liv_area'\**: Above grade (ground) living area square feet       
- **'overall_qual'\**: Overall Quality i.e. material and finish of the house
- **'bsmtfin_sf_1'\**: Basement finished area square feet
- **'garage_area'\**: Size of garage in square feet
- **'1st_flr_sf'\**: First Floor square feet

Top 3 tips for enhancing your Ames home sales value:
1. Maintain good / excellent quality of house thru regular maintenance and upkeep of interior / exterior features
2. Consider remodelling esp if house is old, to reinstate it to its former glory, i.e. Uplift overall quality of house
3. Have good / excellent quality kitchen to attract better prices

### Next Steps:

With your continual strong support I aim to further enhance the robustness of this Lasso pricing model by:
- Exploring other pricing models;
- Continually updating both the data and model to ensure continually accuracy of home sales price and relevancy of strategic and tactic advice I provide to Ames homeowners;   
- Taking into consideration both macro- and micro-economic factors in my pricing model e.g. mortgage rates, crime rates, COVID-19, etc;
- etc.

## Conclusion:

I explored 3 and narrowed down to 1 production model (Lasso) based on the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to predict house sales prices for Ames homeowners and advice ways to maximise sales prices as your data-driven property consultant. 

I also shared the maximum sales price by neighbourhood, top 20 factors with the greatest impact on Ames home sales prices, and top 3 tips for enhancing your Ames home sales value.

With your continual strong support I aim to further enhance the robustness of this pricing model and provide you with continual data-backed advice that maximises the sales value of your priced home.
